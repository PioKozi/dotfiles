# Wallpapers

The wallpapers are some of my favourite strips from the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com).

They have been recoloured by me in GIMP to match the [gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

Relevant comics are:

* [campfire](https://xkcd.com/742/)
* [garbage math](https://xkcd.com/2295/)
* [linux user at best buy](https://xkcd.com/272/)
* [slippery slope](https://xkcd.com/1332/)
